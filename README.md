## Overview

Chief Warden is an open-source command-line tool that analyzes executable files to detect potential malware. By executing binaries in a sandboxed environment and analyzing their behavior using ensemble machine learning techniques, Chief Warden provides robust threat detection with detailed explainability.

The project leverages advanced neural networks and gradient boosting techniques similar to those used in enterprise fraud detection systems (like Stripe's), combining the strengths of both approaches to maximize detection accuracy while minimizing false positives.

## Features

### Current Version (v0.1)

- [x] Cleaned and processed CLAMP dataset for model training
- [x] Created baseline XGBoost model
- [ ] Cuckoo Sandbox integration for safe executable analysis
- [ ] Command-line interface (CLI) for Linux
- [ ] Static analysis of sandbox behavior data
- [ ] Explainability module showing detection reasoning
- [ ] Ensemble model combining DNN and XGBoost
- [ ] GPU acceleration for neural network inference

### Planned Features

- [ ] Dynamic behavioral analysis
- [ ] GNN/LSTM models for API call sequence analysis
- [ ] Integration with larger malware datasets
- [ ] Enhanced explainability with LLM backend
- [ ] Docker containerization for easy deployment
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Real-time monitoring mode
- [ ] Threat intelligence feed integration
- [ ] Network behavioral analysis
- [ ] Web API for remote analysis
- [ ] Integration with SIEM systems
- [ ] Multi-architecture support (ARM, x86)
- [ ] Batch processing capabilities

## Architecture

Chief Warden consists of four main components:

1. **Sandbox Environment**: Executes binaries in an isolated environment to prevent system infection and logs behavioral data
2. **Feature Extraction**: Transforms raw behavioral logs into machine learning features
3. **ML Engine**: Processes extracted features using ensemble models to classify potential threats
4. **Explainability Module**: Provides human-readable explanations of detection decisions


### Sandbox Technology

Chief Warden utilizes Cuckoo Sandbox for creating an isolated execution environment. This prevents potentially malicious code from affecting the host system while allowing for detailed behavioral logging including:

- System calls
- File operations
- Network activity
- Process creation
- Memory operations
- Registry modifications (when analyzing Windows executables through Wine)

### Machine Learning Models

Chief Warden employs an ensemble approach combining:

1. **Deep Neural Networks**: Multi-layer perceptrons designed to identify complex patterns in behavioral data
2. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for efficient feature importance analysis and high accuracy on structured data

This hybrid approach allows us to benefit from both the pattern recognition strengths of neural networks and the feature importance capabilities of tree-based models.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Addy-Da-Baddy/ChiefWarden
cd chief-warden

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

docker run -v /path/to/samples:/samples username/chief-warden analyze /samples/executable.bin
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
chief-warden analyze path/to/executable.bin

# Specify model to use
chief-warden analyze --model ensemble path/to/executable.bin

# Enable verbose output with explanation
chief-warden analyze --verbose --explain path/to/executable.bin

# Use GPU acceleration
chief-warden analyze --gpu path/to/executable.bin

# Specify sandbox timeout (in seconds)
chief-warden analyze --timeout 120 path/to/executable.bin
```

### Example Output

```
Chief Warden v0.1
Analyzing: malicious_sample.exe

[+] Sandbox execution complete
[+] Feature extraction complete
[+] Model prediction: HIGH RISK (0.94)

Explanation:
- Attempts to establish persistence through registry modification
- Creates suspicious files in system directories
- Initiates outbound connections to known malicious IPs
- Encryption of user documents detected
- Process injection behavior observed

Execution terminated. See full report at: /tmp/chief-warden-report-12345.html
```
