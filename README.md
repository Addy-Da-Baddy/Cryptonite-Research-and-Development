## About the Project
Chief Warden is a simple CLI-based malware classification tool. This project is built by an engineering student learning digital forensics and AI, combining both fields in a practical way. It also serves as an opportunity to explore CLI tool deployment. 

This is a simple learning project

The model is inspired by **Stripe's Fraud Detection System** and applies a **Hybrid XGBoost + Neural Network** approach to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as either malware or safe based on static analysis.

## Technical Details
- **Model**: Hybrid XGBoost + Neural Network from static analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Color-coded threat level classification with emoji visualization

---

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (Cross-platform support planned)
- **Python Version**: 3.8 or higher
- **Hardware**:
  - Minimum: 4GB RAM, 2GHz CPU
  - Recommended: CUDA-compatible GPU for neural network acceleration
- **Disk Space**: 500MB (1GB recommended for custom model training)

## Usage Guide

### Basic Malware Scan
```powershell
ChiefWarden --predict "C:\path\to\suspicious.exe"
```
**Sample Output:**
```
[+] Analyzing: suspicious.exe
[+] Feature extraction complete
[+] The file has an 87.34% chance of being malware.
[+] Risk Assessment: ðŸ”´ HIGH RISK - Likely malware, avoid execution.
```

### Advanced Options

**Train Custom Models**:
```powershell
ChiefWarden --train "C:\path\to\dataset.csv" -o "C:\custom_models"
```

**Use Custom Models**:
```powershell
ChiefWarden --predictCustom "C:\custom_models" "C:\path\to\file.exe"
```
